# GameOfSet
GameOfSet is an iOS app of well known card game called __Set__.

## Rules of the game
In this game, there are fixed number of cards. On each card, there are 1, 2 or 3 numbers of identical drawings. A drawing has 3 unique attributes. First is the shape, which can be of 3 kinds i.e. Oval, Diamond & Squiggly. Second is the shading, which again can be of 3 kinds i.e. solid, striped & empty. Third is the color, which also can be of 3 kinds, i.e. red, green & purple.

So in summary a card has 4 attributes:
* Number of shapes (1, 2 or 3)
* Shape type (Oval, Diamond or Squiggly)
* Shading (Solid, Striped or Empty)
* Color (Red, Green or Purple)

In total we can have 81 combinations (3x3x3x3), so there are total 81 cards in the game.

The player of the game has to make a __Set__ using 3 cards. A set has to have either all attributes the same or all different. E.g. a set needs to have same number of shapes or all 3 different. Similarly, the shape type has to be same or all different on the 3 cards.
